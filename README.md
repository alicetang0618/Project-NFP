This project aims to identify mothers that are at risk of premature births. 

There are a number of scripts that have been written to address this problem: param_thresh_working.py and select_param_thresh.py are used to run a number of models with different parameters to find the best possible model. 

skeleton_project.py is the main script with all functions and which is used to train and test the final selected models. 

variable_list.py is a list of variables that are taken from the database (not including features which are additionally created in the code). 

fnocera.py, hw3.py, xiaorui.py are rough scripts that were written for a different project.
